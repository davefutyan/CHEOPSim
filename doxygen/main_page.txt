 <b>Release Version: __trunk__</b>

The CHEOPS simulation software (CHEOPSim) can be used to provide a time 
series of simulated images to represent the data which will be received from 
CHEOPS, including detailed simulation of the field of view, effects which vary 
as a function of the satellite orbit, the telescope optics and the CCD response.
 
 Please find here the [source code documentation] 
 (https://redmine.isdc.unige.ch/projects/cheops/wiki#Documentation) 
 of other SOC CHEOPS software packages. 
 
 
 Please contact the CHEOPS SOC helpdesk <cheops-soc-help@unige.ch>
 if you find any bug or problem in the software or if you
 would like to have a new feature to be implemented.
